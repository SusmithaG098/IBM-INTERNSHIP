AI Agent for Document Interaction: An AI tool that provides instant answers and insights from documents.

Project Description
The AI Agent for Document Interaction is an innovative tool designed to enhance the way users interact with documents. By leveraging advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques, this AI agent provides users with the ability to ask questions, receive instant answers, and obtain summaries from a variety of document types.

This project addresses the challenges of information overload and inefficient document review processes faced by researchers, students, and professionals. The agent streamlines document management by enabling semantic searches, contextual understanding, and multi-document analysis, ultimately improving productivity and decision-making.

Key features include:

Interactive query system for natural language questions
Automatic summarization of lengthy documents
Context-aware responses that adapt to user interactions
Support for analyzing multiple documents simultaneously
By integrating this AI agent into workflows, users can significantly reduce the time spent on document review and enhance their overall research and information retrieval experience.
